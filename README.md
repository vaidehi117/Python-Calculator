Calculator Operations

This module provides basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division. These operations accept two floating-point numbers as input and return the 
result as a floating-point number. Additionally, the division function handles division by zero 
with an appropriate error message.

Functions:
    - addition(a: float, b: float) -> float: Adds two numbers.
    - subtraction(a: float, b: float) -> float: Subtracts the second number from the first.
    - multiplication(a: float, b: float) -> float: Multiplies two numbers.
    - division(a: float, b: float) -> float: Divides the first number by the second, 
      raises ValueError for division by zero.
